# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction using LSTM repository. This Python code utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. This README file provides an overview of the code and instructions on how to use it effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (with Keras)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Code Overview

This code performs the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries: Import required Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

2. Defining a function to create a time series dataset: This function prepares the dataset for time series analysis by splitting it into input features (X) and target values (Y).

3. Loading historical stock price data: Load historical stock price data from a CSV file named 'stock_data.csv.' Make sure to replace it with your own dataset.

4. Extracting the 'Close' column: Extract the 'Close' price column as the target variable for prediction.

5. Normalizing the data: Normalize the data between 0 and 1 using Min-Max scaling to improve model training.

6. Setting the number of time steps to look back: Define the number of previous time steps to consider when predicting the future stock price. This is controlled by the `look_back` parameter.

7. Creating the time series dataset: Prepare the dataset by creating sequences of historical data with the specified look back.

8. Splitting the data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

9. Building the LSTM model: Create an LSTM neural network model with a specified architecture.

10. Training the model: Train the model using the training data and monitor its performance using validation data.

11. Making predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

12. Evaluating the model: Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.

13. Plotting the predictions: Visualize the model's predictions compared to the actual stock prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the code:

1. Ensure you have met the prerequisites and installed the required dependencies.

2. Place your historical stock price data in a CSV file named 'stock_data.csv' (or update the file path in the code to your dataset).

3. Customize the model architecture and training parameters according to your specific requirements.

4. Run the code using a Python interpreter:

   ```
   python stock_price_prediction.py
   ```

5. The code will load your data, preprocess it, train the LSTM model, make predictions, and display the RMSE along with a plot comparing the predicted and true stock prices.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code to fit your specific needs. You can experiment with different hyperparameters, try different LSTM architectures, or use alternative evaluation metrics for model performance.
